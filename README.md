# PassW
A Python script to generate random passwords
Password Generator and Manager

This Python script is part of a small project that puts Python knowledge into practice. It serves as an application that generates random passwords and stores them in a text document, associating each password with the user-provided name of a website or application. The script prompts the user for the desired password length, complexity level (low, medium, or high), and the name of the website or app for which the password will be used.

Low complexity: Generates passwords with lowercase letters and numbers.
Medium complexity: Generates passwords with lowercase and uppercase letters, as well as numbers.
High complexity: Generates passwords with lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and punctuation marks.
Upon saving and exiting, the script automatically creates a text document (or updates an existing one) where the names of websites/apps are stored along with their corresponding passwords.

Feel free to utilize, enhance, and contribute to this Python script. Your feedback and improvements are highly encouraged!
